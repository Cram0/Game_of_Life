# Game of Life
A simple game made in C++ based on Conway's Game of Life.

The only reason I made this was to get used to my new keyboard layout.

It might be buggy as I really didn't want to optimize it in any way, but should work without any problems.


### How to launch it
Launching the game is fairly simple :<br>
`git clone git@github.com:Cram0/Game_of_Life.git && cd Game_of_Life`<br>
`make launch`

(Don't mind the horrible framerate caused by the compression)
